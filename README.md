## Detailed Module Overviews

### 1. Proteome-Quantification

* **Purpose:** Secondary analysis of Mass Spectrometry-based Proteomics data in R.
* **Scope:** This module outlines the essential steps in analyzing proteomics data, focusing on differential abundance. It assumes a simple experimental design (e.g., two conditions) using TMT10plex multiplex design with MS3 data acquisition.
* **Key Learnings:** You will gain a strong understanding of mass spectrometry and statistical terminology for data preprocessing, normalization, and differential abundance analysis using **R**.
* **Note:** This resource was forked from NIGMS/Proteome-Quantification and developed by UAMS for the NIH NIGMS Sandbox project.

### 2. Biomedical-Imaging-Analysis-using-AI-ML-Approaches

* **Purpose:** Machine Learning educational module for cloud-based biomedical image analysis.
* **Motivation:** Addresses the need for advanced data analysis tools, specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning, to identify complex, hidden patterns in multidimensional data (e.g., images).
* **Technology Focus:** **Deep Learning**—the utilization of neural networks for tasks such as:
    * Cancer detection
    * Cell and tissue segmentation
    * Particle tracking
* **Module Content:** The course covers generating and training a neural network, manipulating datasets, applying the trained network to new data, and quantifying its performance.
* **Accessibility:** This module is available for both **AWS** and **Google Cloud**.
* **Cost Estimate:** The entire module is designed to cost approximately **$1.00** to run, assuming all resources are correctly terminated upon completion.
* **Video:** [Watch this Introduction Video to learn more about the module.](PLACEHOLDER_FOR_YOUTUBE_LINK)
